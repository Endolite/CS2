/*
Build a program that does the following instructions:
  - Generates a random integer between 1 and 5 without showing it to the user
  - Displays to the user if the generated integer is an odd or an even number
  - Asks the user to guess a number
  - Reads the userâ€™s guess
  - Displays if the entered number was less than or greater than the generated integer
  - Once the user guesses the number, then display a congratulations message.
